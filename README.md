# Karel
Certainly! Here’s a concise summary of Karel’s programming features:

Karel is a simple robot that operates in a rectangular grid-world with vertical avenues (up-down) and horizontal streets (left-right). It understands five basic instructions:

    move(): Moves Karel one square in the direction it’s facing. Karel will crash if there’s a wall blocking the way.
    turn_left(): Rotates Karel 90 degrees to the left (counterclockwise).
    put_beeper(): Places a beeper on the current corner.
    pick_beeper(): Lifts a beeper from the current corner (throws an error if no beepers are present).
    turn_off(): Ends the program.

Additionally, you can create your own Karel functions to teach it new tasks! 🤖🔍📏1. Your work of writing approximately 10 main programs for practical tasks like finding zebra crossings and climbing mountains can indeed be fed to Karel as a Python file, allowing it to execute those tasks2. 🚀🐍
